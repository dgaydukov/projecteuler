# Project Euler

This is my approach to [Porject euler](https://projecteuler.net/). Every respected developer should try it, and solve at least the first 100. Well, we will see how far will I go.
The language is C++, cause this is the best language to tackle algorithmic and math tasks.
My main accent here is on general solutions. Take a look at task 1, instead of directly hardcoding 3 and 5 as values, I pass them as array to function. So you can easily enlarge this array to 2,3,5 and so on to play around.
